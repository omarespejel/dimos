"""Native Rust voxel-map module with raycast clearing.

Subscribes to a world-frame ``PointCloud2`` (e.g. from FastLio2's
``lidar`` output) and matching ``Odometry``, maintains a global
voxel hash set, and publishes the accumulated map on ``global_map``
as a :class:`DynamicCloud` (per-voxel health + slow-clock sequence
stamp).

Algorithm (v1):
    * Insert the voxel of every point into the global hash set.
    * For every point, walk the 3-D DDA ray from the latest
      odometry position to the point and remove every intermediate
      voxel from the map.  The endpoint voxel is preserved.
    * A "slow clock" sequence counter increments every
      ``sequence_period_secs`` (default 1.0s).  Any voxel touched
      while still uncertain (health <= 0) is stamped with the
      current sequence value; once health > 0 the stamp freezes,
      capturing "when did this voxel become confirmed."

Map override:
    Publishing to ``map_override`` with a :class:`DynamicCloud`
    fully replaces the internal voxel state with the override's
    contents.  The slow-clock counter snaps to
    ``max(override.sequence)``, even if that's less than the
    current value — the override is authoritative.

The Rust binary at ``rust/`` does the heavy lifting.
