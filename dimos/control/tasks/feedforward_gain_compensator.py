"""Static feedforward gain compensator (Strategy B).

Sits between any path-following controller and the platform. Rather than
closing a velocity loop with a PID (which requires actual_velocity feedback
and is fragile when cascaded over a firmware that already tracks velocity),
this compensator just **inverts the steady-state plant gain** so the
controller's "I want vx=X" command actually produces vx=X at the wheels:

    cmd_to_robot = controller_cmd / K_plant

Stateless, no actual feedback needed, no phase-margin issues. Works as
long as K is reasonably accurate. Trade: doesn't compensate for plant
dynamics (tau, L) - controller's own outer loop handles those via pose
feedback.
