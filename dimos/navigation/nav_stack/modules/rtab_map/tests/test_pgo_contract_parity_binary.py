"""Contract parity between PGOCpp and PGORust (and the LoopClosure Spec).

The DoD says nav_stack must be able to pick between `pgo_cpp` and `pgo_rust`
backends behind the same `loop_closure` parameter. That swap is only safe if
both modules declare the *same* set of input/output streams with the *same*
types.  This is the structural check — it does NOT spin up either binary, so
it runs in <1s and never flakes on host LCM noise.

Originally this file lived on the `jeff/feat/rtabmap` branch, where rtab_map
was the alternative SLAM provider to pgo. On this branch (`jeff/feat/rust_pgo`)
the alternative is pgo_rust, so the parity check is PGOCpp ↔ PGORust ↔
LoopClosure Spec instead.
